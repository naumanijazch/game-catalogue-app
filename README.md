## Notes

- Why react query?

1. no request cancelling
2. no separation of concerns
3. No retries
4. No automatic refresh
5. No caching

- React query >>> redux

- Reducer
  A function that allows us to centralize state updates in a component.

- For server state -> react query
- For client state -> local state + react context OR use only Zustand

# Redux is a statemanagement library for JS apps

It stores local variable storage in a global state rather than storing local variables in components. Thus we dont need props to manage data between different components
